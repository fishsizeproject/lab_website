    "text": "General properties of intra-specific size distributions\n\n\nAre there general rules that govern relatives abundances of small, medium and large fish in a population? Are these rules consistent across fish groups, habitats, temperature and geographic regions? And if so, can these rules be applied to quantify fishing and other impacts on fish populations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAims\n\nWe are using large datasets from underwater visual surveys, sampling and other sources to explore shapes of body size distributions across hundreds of fish species. Our results suggest that these distributions are relatively consistent across species ranging from 10cm to 1.5 meters in body size. This suggests that growth and mortality, which determine population and species size distributions, may also be constrained.\nThe next step is to assess spatial and temporal scales over which body size distributions become unpredictable and how the importance of life-history and environmental conditions in explaining the residual variation from the general patterns.\n\nWe are keen to test the generality of body size distributions across a much larger ranges of species and habitats, and across different data collection methods. For that we need individual size data from natural fish populations without much fishing pressure. If you would like to collaborate with us - get in touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreprint: Temperature affects fish body sizes.

    "text": "Temperature impacts on fish sizes\n\n\nTemperature has large impacts on fish sizes, both naturally and also through human induced climate change. However, it is still not clear how temperature might affect growth, size structure or mean sizes in natural populations and we use diverse data sources and simulations to explore that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAims\n\nUsing underwater visual survey data from Reef Life Survey we show that mean lengths of fish in natural populations can either increase or decrease with temperature changes across space. This temperature driven change in mean length is very strong (3% change per 1C), which means that average fish length on the warm and cool edge of the fish distribution area can be up to 30% different. Moreover, global warming driven changes in average fish size through time are often qualitatively similar, but rate of change is nearly 10 times faster. But this raises many other questions, which we aim to answer below. \nIs the increase in mean size in warmer waters compatible with the temperature size rule, which states that in warmer conditions fish grow to smaller maturation sizes? \nFish size distributions are shaped by rates of growth and mortality, and by using simulation modelling we can manipulate these two parameters to see how population mean and maximum size might change under different temperature conditions. Using these methods we can show that it is possible to get increasing population mean sizes, even though the maximum and asymptotic size may be declining, as predicted by the temperature size rule.\n\n\n\nMajor findings\nFor a full list of the impacts and outcomes of this research, see Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."

If so, we could use these rules to predict unfished size frequencies in nearly all fish species.\nTo date most analyses on fish size frequencies were conducted on commercially fished species, where fishing impacts have been extensive and long lasting. But new data sources, from underwater visual surveys, such as Reef Life Survey now provides opporunities to explore size distributions in hundreds of diverse and unfished species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature impacts on fish sizes\nTemperature affects fish sizes, both naturally and through human induced climate change.
