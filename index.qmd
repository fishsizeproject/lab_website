The **Fish Size Project** is an international research collaboration led by a team of scientists at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Science, University of Tasmania, Australia. We aim to understand human impacts on fish size structure in Australia and globally and to advance application of size based methods for fisheries management and conservation.

## Our goals

Understand general properties of natural fish size frequency distributions

## Our mission 

Humans have fished out most of the large fish. Climate change is also affecting fish sizes. Such changes to the natural fish population size structure impact fish population and ecosystem resilience. However, most fish populations are not assessed and humans impacts of fish size diversity loss remain undocumented. <br><br> We are using traditional and new sources of fish size data to understand how many small and large fish we should expect in natural populations, how fishing and warming are affecting these numbers and how we could restore what is lost.

### [Properties of intra-specific size distributions](pages/research.qmd#sec-size-distribution-properties)

Are there general rules that govern species size distributions in natural populations? If so, we could use these rules to predict unfished size frequencies in nearly all fish species. 

To date most analyses on fish size frequencies were conducted on commercially fished species, where fishing impacts have been extensive and long lasting. But new data sources, from underwater visual surveys, such as [Reef Life Survey](https://reeflifesurvey.com) now provides opporunities to explore size distributions in hundreds of diverse and unfished species.

### [Temperature impacts on fish sizes](pages/research.qmd#sec-temp-impacts)

Temperature affects fish sizes, both naturally and through human induced climate change. Growth, mortality, reproduction and species composition are all affected by temperature. But what are the mechanisms and how do these temperature impacts manifest in natural populations, through space and time? 

We use diverse data sources and simulations to explore temperature impacts on fish growth, size structure and population dynamics.

### [Applying size based models to assess human impacts](pages/research.qmd##sec-size-models-impacts)

Size based models are a powerful tool to assess human impacts on fish populations. Traditionally these methods are used with catch data, but rapid accumulation of alternative data sources, such as visual census, citizen science, recreational fishing and underwater cameras, provide an opportunity to expand assessments across hundreds of fish species. 

We are exploring best approaches to improve applications of size based population and community models to document human impacts in data poor fisheries and aquatic ecosystems in general.

### [Using historical records to understand shifting baselines](pages/research.qmd#sec-historical-shifting-baselines)

Historical records, such as old newspapers, logbooks, photos and archival records can provide valuable information about status of fish populations before detailed surveys began. These records are crucial to improve our understanding about natural fish sizes and address shifting baselines. 

We are working with researches around the world to find new ways to use historical data in fish population assessments.
