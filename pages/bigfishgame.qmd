# Big Fish card game

To encourage sustainable recreational fishing and marine literacy and to communicate the importance of big fish for fish populations and ecosystems we have developed a fun and engageing card game [**Big Fish**](https://bigfishcardgame.com). The game is already gaining popularity with schools and has been tested across different sectors. The game will be officially launched with a crowdfunding in September 2024, during the [Australian Marine Sciences Association annual meeting in Hobart](https://www.amsa2024.amsa.asn.au/). 

The Big Fish card game has been developed by [Matt Testoni](team.qmd) and illustrated by [Amy Coghlan](team.qmd) (we do have lots of talent in the team!). All funds raised during the crowdfunding will contribute to promoting education and engagement.
